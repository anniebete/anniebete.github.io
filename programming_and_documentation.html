				   <h3>Spring Semester, 2020</h3>

				   <h5>Languages: C & C++</h5>
				   <p>For the majority of Spring semester, 2020, I worked as part of a four-person team in my Fundamentals of Engineering Honors class (ENGR 1282.01H). Our task was to design, build, program, and document a robot to perform several tasks. Although our robot was not able to be completed as a result of online-only courses during the COVID19 pandemic, it was on track to be completed on time and in budget. The video below shows testing footage of our robot performing all of the tasks.</p>
				   
				   <p>I was the lead programmer and documentation secondary for my team. As documentation secondary, I led my team in the development of our electronic portfolio (website) and presentation. I was responsible for the majority of the code and robot testing documentation. In addition, I helped my team stay on top of deadlines and track our progress.</p>
				   <h5>Sample Documentation:</h5>
				   <ul>
					   <li>The general overview of the <a href="/files/Software.pdf">code structure and logic.</a></li>
				   <li>Since the program was so modular, it was easy to break the code down and describe specific functions in more detail, as shown <a href="/files/Function Sets.pdf">here</a>.</li>
				   <li>As a programmer, documenting our testing was very important to me. A copy and explanation of our detailed testing log can be found <a href= "/files/TestingLog.pdf">here</a>.</li>
					   <li>I created this <a href="/files/ProjectOverviewFinal.xlsx">Microsoft Excel spreadsheet</a> to breakdown team tasks and track progress. It can also be viewed as a <a href="/files/Project-Overview-Final.pdf">PDF</a>.</li>

				   <h3>Autumn Semester, 2019</h3>

				   <h5>Languages: C & C++</h5>
				   <p>For the last week of Autumn semester, 2019, I worked as part of a two-person partnership in my Fundamentals of Engineering Honors class (ENGR 1281). Our task was to design, program, and document a video game.</p>
				   
				   <p>I created the infographic (shown below) to describe our game, “Stacker.” My responsibility on the project was working on the design and programming of game itself while my partner worked on creating the main menu and scoring interface. I documented the software design and construction, as shown below. Our team won “Best Documentation” in our class.</p>
				   <h5>Sample Documentation:</h5>
				   <ul>
				   <li>The general overview of the code structure and logic (represented by <a href="/files/SDP_Pseudocode.pdf">pseudocode</a> and a <a href="/files/SDP_Flowchart.pdf">flow chart</a>).</li>
					   <li>A <a href="/files/SDP_Developers.pdf">Program Description for Developers</a>.</li>

					<h2>iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) Competition</h2>
			   </div>
			   <div class="col-md-9">
				   <p>In the late Spring of my sophomore year, Carroll High School and Air Force Research Laboratories (AFRL) collaborated to create its inagural iGEM team. iGEM is a competition where high school, undergraduate, and overgraduate teams brainstorm, design, and conduct research on a synthetic biology project. Outside of the research, a large part of the project involves collaborating with other iGEM teams and reaching out to people who might use your project. In the fall, teams travel to Boston, MA to present their project to experts at the International Jamboree.</p>
				   <p>Each team must also create a wiki page on the iGEM server (MediaWiki platform) to document their entire project. Although they are called a "wiki page", in reality they are full websites. Not only is the wiki page a medal requirement, but it is the way that teams document all of their work for the current (and future) teams, the judges, and the public.</p>
				   <h3>2017</h3>
				   <p>When our team first began, no one had any website experience, including myself. I immediately started playing around with the code, but was unable to change anything besides fonts and colors. I took a Codecademy HTML/CSS course to familiarize myself with the basics, then began to try to design the website. Fortunately, two other people on the team were interested in helping with the design and, between the three of us, we were able to create a basic wiki, which you can access by clicking the image below.</p>

					  </a>
					
					<h2>2018</h2>																	 
																						 
					<p>Although our 2017 wiki accomplished what we needed it to do and had a clean design, we knew that it was missing some elements, especially making it mobile-friendly. Going into 2018, our big wiki goal was to make the page responsive.</p>
				   <p>In 2018 there were only two of us focusing on the wiki design. We  looked into some different ways of doing this and ultimately favored using Bootstrap. We tried this in 2017, but due to an iGEM rule that all content must be hosted on the iGEM server, we were unable to link to external pages. Linking to stylesheets on the iGEM server was not commonly done, but with the help of some other teams we were finally able to figure out how to make it work.</p>
				   <p>This marked a turning point for our wiki, which can be accessed below. Now that we had more experience, our design also improved. Our team's decision to have consistant branding made the wiki more cohesive. Finally, we started to work more design into it. I created the <a href="design_gallery.html">Airplane Design Collection</a> to use as a main design element.</p>
				   
				   <a href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:US_AFRL_CarrollHS">
					   <div class="card" style="width: 100%;">
						<img src="/img/2018_iGEM_Screenshot.png" class="card-img-top">
					   </div>
					  </a>
				   
				   <h2>2019</h2>
				   <p>By 2019, both of the other team members who helped with the wiki had graduated, so I mainly played around with the design on my own, and got feedback from my team along the way. I also felt the most confident this year. The struggles of the past two years set me up so that I knew what needed to be done and could spend more time designing and less time debugging.</p>
				   
				   <p>It also marked my last year on the team and I knew that I wanted to save others as much trouble as possible. I decided to lead an iGEM collaboration to teach others how to put together a wiki and outline their options. I created a <a href ="https://2019.igem.org/Team:US_AFRL_CarrollHS/WikiGuide">written guide</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg5B0YEXzgEorRa8vuZPoHaH5e1jmgVQ6">YouTube series</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/us-afrl-carrollhs">GitHub repositories</a> to effectively communicate the development process. I also provided myself as a resource to teams to try to help them debug their code.</p>
				   <p>To truly make this successful, though, I knew that I needed the help of other teams. I  reached out to at least 200 teams (I stopped tracking at that point) and had over 30 teams collaborate by writing content and giving feedback on what had been written. We could see that it was successful by the feedback we were getting. One of the most memorable was when someone had the Jamboree (competition) approached us after our presentation to tell us how she wouldn't have been able to get Bootstrap to work without our help. This meant a lot, since it was something I had stuggled with for the first two years.</p>

					<h2>Websites for Course Projects</h2>
			   </div>
			   <div class="col-md-9">
				   <h3>Fundamentals of Engineering Honors</h3>
				   <h5>Software Design Project | Robot Project</h5>
				   <p>My freshman year engineering course required two websites: one at the end of Autumn (2019) semester for a partner Software Design Project and one at the end of Spring (2020) semester for a four-person robot project. More details on each of the projects, along with some sample pages, can be found above. Both websites were required to use WordPress and be hosted by Ohio State. They are unaccessable to the public.</p>
				   
				   <h3>Engineering Writing Course</h3>
				   <h5>Career Portfolio</h5>
				   
				   <p>This career website began as the final project for the second-year writing course that I took Spring Semester, 2020. It was the first time I was able to have complete freedom with a website. I used GitHub pages (for the first time) to host it. Through this experience I learned a lot about putting together a website using multiple HTML and CSS files. I also dove deeper into creating responsive webpages by using media queries.</p>
